# Assembly Practice Problems
### Getting started
* To compile, run `make build`.
* To clean the build directory, run `make clean`.
* To compile the reference solution, run `SRC="ref" make build`

### Tips and Tricks
* Read the code under `sample assembly` and use them as skeletons in your design
* Use gdb to debug your assembly
* Avoid looking at the reference solution
* Try out the context switch problem; will be very useful in Operating Systems
